## Hi there 🤝

- 🔬 I’m currently working on deconvolution of lightsheet images to analyze bacterial growth in 3D. 
- 📚 🧠 I’m currently learning python for data analytics and python computational methods for applications in physics. 
- 👟 Fun fact: When I'm not staring at a computer screen I enjoy getting outside and running, hiking or golfing.
